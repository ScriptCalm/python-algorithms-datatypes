# Python Algorithms and Data Types Collection

This repository contains selected Python exercises developed during coursework on algorithms and data types.  
The tasks cover fundamental programming and algorithmic concepts such as:

- Time complexity (Big-O notation examples)  
- Binary search  
- Recursion (string reversal examples)  
- Data structures (stack, queue, linked list)  
- Sorting algorithms (selection sort, insertion sort)
